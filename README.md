## Hurdles
My main hurdle was sticking/thinking of a theme. Because of this there is no styling. :(

## Hopes and Dreams
If I was more focused and/or had more time I would do more:
- add animations
- progress bar for song playback
- test and add mobile responsives

## Game Object
I wanted the game object to not interact with anything in the Browser. So I took out any outside references to elements and console.

## Word Object
I got the *basic* functionality earlier on then decided to use a word object *and* an interactive player later.  The word object stores all info to assets for the player.

## Misc
initially used this word list for play testing:
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Basic_English_word_list#Things_-_200_picturable_words

Used this to help with replacing the blank in word display:

Used indexOf everywhere:

Splice is used to get a random word from array of available words:

Math.random():
